# Here we create a screen object to setup the screen size and the background color for our clock.
screen = turtle.Screen() 

# Setting up a screen of width 700 and height 500 pixels, starting x position is 0, starting y position is 0.

screen.setup(700, 500, 0, 0)     # setup (width, height, starting x, starting y)
screen.bgcolor("orange")     # the background color of our clock is orange


# Next we are going to draw the clock's dial. We need a turtle object to draw on the screen, so we have created a turtle object and named it 'dial'

dial = turtle.Turtle()    # turtle object to draw the clock
dial.shape("circle")      # the shape of our clock is a circle.

# Here we have set the drawing speed of our turtle 'dial'. The speed can be a number from 0 to 10 or a string "fastest", "fast", "normal", "slow", "slowest". 0 is fastest, 1 is slowest, numbers 2-10 are very slow to very fast.
dial.speed(0)


# Next we draw the seconds marks on the clock's dial. We will use a for loop that will run 60 times because there are 60 seconds around the dial of the clock.

# We will also use If/Else conditionals to decide when to draw small black seconds marks and when to draw the big red seconds marks on our clock. The order in which the If/Else conditions are met makes a pattern, 0 1 2 3 4 - 0 1 2 3 4 - 0 1 2 3 4 and so on. This happens because in our for loop we are taking a mod of each number from 0 to 60 with 5. Why do we need this special pattern? Because we start drawing our clock's dial with 1 big red seconds mark followed by 4 small black seconds marks, then again 1 big red mark and then 4 small black marks and we keep doing this 60 times. 

# The If condition is met whenever i % 5 is 0. i % 5 is 0 after every four iterations of the for loop, that is whenever we get a multiple of 5 for example 0, 5, 10, 15, 20 and so on....
# i % 5 is 0   when   0 % 5 is 0,   5 % 5 is 0,   10 % 5 is 0,   15 % 5 is 0,   20 % 5 is 0 and so on.

# The Else condition is met whenever i % 5 is not 0
# i % 5 is not 0   when   1 % 5 is 1,   2 % 5 is 2,   3 % 5 is 3,   4 % 5 is 4,   6 % 5 is 1,  7 % 5 is 2,   8 % 5 is 3,   9 % 5 is 4,   11 % 5 is 1,   12 % 5 is 2,   13 % 5 is 3,   14 % 5 is 4 and so on and so forth.

# In our 0 1 2 3 4 - 0 1 2 3 4 pattern, 0 represents the red marks on the dial and 1 2 3 4 represents the black marks on the dial of the clock.
